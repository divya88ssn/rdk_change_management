Note: checking out 'SERXW3_DEV_3.2.0.3.2'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

Your .gclient file seems to be broken. The requested URL is different from what
is actually checked out in /mnt/jenkins/workspace/SERXW3-Release/release. In the future this will be an
error.

Expected: https://gerrit.teamccp.com/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3.git@SERXW3_DEV_3.2.0.3.2 (git)
Actual:   https://gerrit.teamccp.com/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3.git (git)

You should ensure that the URL listed in .gclient is correct and either change
it or fix the checkout. If you're managing your own git checkout in
/mnt/jenkins/workspace/SERXW3-Release/release but the URL in .gclient is for an svn repository, you probably
want to set 'managed': False in .gclient.

Your .gclient file seems to be broken. The requested URL is different from what
is actually checked out in /mnt/jenkins/workspace/SERXW3-Release/release. In the future this will be an
error.

Expected: https://gerrit.teamccp.com/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3.git@SERXW3_DEV_3.2.0.3.2 (git)
Actual:   https://gerrit.teamccp.com/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3.git (git)

You should ensure that the URL listed in .gclient is correct and either change
it or fix the checkout. If you're managing your own git checkout in
/mnt/jenkins/workspace/SERXW3-Release/release but the URL in .gclient is for an svn repository, you probably
want to set 'managed': False in .gclient.
