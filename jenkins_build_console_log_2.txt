Your .gclient file seems to be broken. The requested URL is different from what
is actually checked out in /mnt/jenkins/workspace/SERXW3-Build/opt/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3/3.2_p1c/. In the future this will be an
error.

Expected: https://gerrit.teamccp.com/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3.git@3.2_p1c (git)
Actual:   https://gerrit.teamccp.com/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3.git (git)

You should ensure that the URL listed in .gclient is correct and either change
it or fix the checkout. If you're managing your own git checkout in
/mnt/jenkins/workspace/SERXW3-Build/opt/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3/3.2_p1c/ but the URL in .gclient is for an svn repository, you probably
want to set 'managed': False in .gclient.

________ running 'git checkout --quiet master' in '/mnt/jenkins/workspace/SERXW3-Build/opt/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3/3.2_p1c/ems/3rdparty/usrsctplib'
Checked out master to a detached HEAD. Before making any commits
in this repo, you should use 'git checkout <branch>' to switch to
an existing branch or use 'git checkout origin -b <branch>' to
create a new branch for your work.

Your .gclient file seems to be broken. The requested URL is different from what
is actually checked out in /mnt/jenkins/workspace/SERXW3-Build/opt/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3/3.2_p1c/. In the future this will be an
error.

Expected: https://gerrit.teamccp.com/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3.git@3.2_p1c (git)
Actual:   https://gerrit.teamccp.com/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3.git (git)

You should ensure that the URL listed in .gclient is correct and either change
it or fix the checkout. If you're managing your own git checkout in
/mnt/jenkins/workspace/SERXW3-Build/opt/rdk/projects/sercomm/sercomm_xw3/3.2_p1c/ but the URL in .gclient is for an svn repository, you probably
want to set 'managed': False in .gclient.
